# Beesies

> **Note:** This modpack is built for my own personal server. While I'd be honoured if other people used it, it is not in active development and issues might not get resolved for a long time.

In this modpack you'll find some new content (like food and mobs), but it mostly enhances the atmosphere and general gameplay (sounds, seasons, etc.). Config files have been changed to suit my preference and to ensure the proper workings of the modpack as a whole.
Being built on a version of [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), you shouldn't have a lot of problems running this version of Beesies. You might even be able to try one of the included shaderpacks!

## Installing
1. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/koninginsamira/Beesies/releases/latest).
2. Download the .zip file containing the source.
3. Start your preferred modpack manager (I'd recommend [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org))
4. Import the downloaded .zip file as modpack.
5. Wait for the process to finish and enjoy!
